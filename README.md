# Al-Future-Directions-
# Edge AI & IoT Project

## Overview
This repository contains the practical implementation of an Edge AI and AI-driven IoT project, along with ethical and futuristic AI proposals. The project is divided into three main parts:

- **Part 2: Practical Implementation**
  - **Task 1:** Edge AI Prototype (Image Classification for Recyclables)
  - **Task 2:** AI-Driven IoT Concept (Smart Agriculture)
  - **Task 3:** Ethics in Personalized Medicine
- **Part 3: Futuristic AI Proposal (2030)**

## Part 2: Practical Implementation

### Task 1: Edge AI Prototype
- **Goal:** Train a lightweight image classification model for recyclable items and deploy it using TensorFlow Lite.
- **Files:**
  - `recycle_classifier.ipynb` → Notebook with training, evaluation, and TFLite conversion.
  - `recycle_model.h5` → Trained Keras model.
  - `recycle_model.tflite` → Converted TensorFlow Lite model.
- **Instructions:** Open the notebook and run each cell. Modify dataset paths as needed. Sample images are included for testing inference.

### Task 2: Smart Agriculture Proposal
- **Goal:** AI-driven IoT system to predict crop yields.
- **Files:**
  - `proposal.pdf` → 1-page proposal with AI workflow.
  - `diagram.png` → Data flow diagram.
  - `sensors_list.md` → List of sensors used.

### Task 3: Ethics in Personalized Medicine
- **Goal:** Identify biases in AI-based treatment recommendations.
- **Files:**
  - `ethics_analysis.pdf` → 300-word analysis on fairness strategies.

## Part 3: Futuristic AI Proposal (2030)
- **Goal:** Propose a novel AI application for 2030.
- **Files:**
  - `AI_2030_Concept.pdf` → Concept paper describing problem, AI workflow, and societal risks/benefits.
